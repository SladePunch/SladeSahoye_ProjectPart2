                <h2>General Travel FAQ</h2>
                <div id="accordion">
                    <h3>How far in advance should I book my flights and accommodations?</h3>
                    <div>Booking travel and accommodations at least two to three months in advance will typically result
                        in the best
                        deals and availability.
                        If you're willing to take the risk, flexibility can sometimes result in last-minute offers.
                    </div>

                    <h3>What are some essential items to pack for a trip?</h3>
                    <div>

                        toiletries,
                        medication,

                        Don't forget your sense of adventure too!</div>

                    <h3>How can I find the best deals on flights and accommodations?</h3>
                    <div>Use ticket comparison websites, sign up for airline newsletters for unique discounts, book at
                        off-peak
                        times, and make use
                        of reward programs to find the best deals. Try making your reservation directly with the hotel
                        to see if
                        there are any savings

                        watchful in crowded areas,
                        securing your possessions, and avoiding dangerous situations. It is also advisable to obtain
                        travel

                        expenses.</div>

                    <div>Inform your bank of your travel plans ahead of time to avoid card complications while overseas.
                        When
                        possible,
                        use credit cards with no international transaction fees, and for added convenience, carry both

                        relaxation
                        first, and assigning duties when needed to maintain a work-life balance while running a travel

                        taking regular
                        breaks, and engaging in mindfulness practices. To keep your content engaging and motivating,

                        travel and adventure.</div>
